I decided to “port” [AURIX Development Studio][ads] (ADS) to [CDT.cloud][cdt-cloud] to explore the feasibility, understand the challenges and possibly give a contribution to the project.

In this serie of posts I will report my progresses, document the process and the challenges with the hope they will help other developers achieving similar tasks.
