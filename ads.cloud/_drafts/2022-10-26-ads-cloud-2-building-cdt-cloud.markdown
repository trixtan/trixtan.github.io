The first step I decided to do is to install the already existing [CDT.cloud][cdt-cloud] in my remote virtual server (a VPS I have by the provider Hetzner).
I want to manage everything with Docker.

## Building CDT.cloud docker image
The CDT.cloud documentation suggests the command to create the docker image:

```sh
docker build -t cdt-cloud-blueprint:latest -f dockerfile/Dockerfile .
```
### webpack and SIGKILL
I faced the following issue building the Docker image:

```sh
cdt-cloud-blueprint-browser: Error: webpack exited with an unexpected signal: SIGKILL.
cdt-cloud-blueprint-browser:     at ChildProcess.<anonymous> (/home/theia/cdt-cloud-blueprint/node_modules/@theia/application-manager/lib/application-process.js:59:28)
cdt-cloud-blueprint-browser:     at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:400:28)
cdt-cloud-blueprint-browser:     at maybeClose (internal/child_process.js:1088:16)

```
Linux has a mechanism that can kill processes when they drain too much resources. Since my server is quite limited in resources (only 2GB of RAM and 1 core), I thought the problem might be that webpack is too heavy for this configuration.

In fact, a call to `dmesg` shows:
```sh
[ 1077.609009] Out of memory: Kill process 9229 (webpack) score 303 or sacrifice child
[ 1077.610169] Killed process 9229 (webpack) total-vm:33465112kB, anon-rss:1166192kB, file-rss:0kB, shmem-rss:0kB
```
**Solution**
1. Build the Docker image on a stronger machine (I used my laptop)
1. Export the image:
	```sh
	docker save cdt-cloud-blueprint | gzip > cdt-cloud-blueprint.tgz
	```
1. Upload the tgzipped image to the remote server
1. Load and retag the image on the server
	```sh
	docker load -i cdt-cloud-blueprint.tgz
	docker image tag cdt-cloud-blueprint cdt-cloud-blueprint:latest
	```
